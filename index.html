</h1>
  <p>Every now and then, you’ll either drive past a road accident or see one on the news. You’ll think about it for a couple of seconds, but it doesn’t really stick around in your mind for too long – unless of course, you are the one experiencing the crash. In that case, you’ll probably remember it for the rest of your life.
    
    However, are you able to really comprehend the prevalence of road accidents across the year in Victoria? 

    In this visualisation, we explore the overall trends of road accidents across Victoria in the year 2018, and hone into the different categories including, but not limited to time periods, accident types, and location.
  </p>


<h2>What month and day has the most car accidents?</h2>
  
<p>The road crashes in Victoria are visualised by each month in 2018. It is broken down by two factors, which is whether they occurred in Metro or Country Victoria.
    
  It is evident that Metro Victoria experienced a greater amount of road crashes, where this could be attributed to the greater population and settlement in Metro Victoria compared to Country Victoria.
    
  In 2018, March (1,027) experienced the highest number of road crashes, followed by May (922). On the contrary, September experienced the least number of road crashes (761).
</p>

 <p>Surprisingly, the weekend experienced the least number of road accidents in 2018. This could be due to individuals commuting to work throughout the week but staying home over the weekend. Further, all the weekdays number of road accidents were very similar, with Thursday being the most common day for road accidents to occur.<p>
 </p>
  
  <div id="bar-day"></div>
  
<h2>Are there more accidents in the Metropolitan or Country Victoria?</h2>
  <p>The map highlights the distribution of road accidents, which is evidently in the Metro Victoria and neighbouring Country Victoria. Occasional accidents also appear further out in the Country but are less frequent due to the smaller number of individuals and families residing in those areas.
  
  Struck of animals are commonly seen in the Country Victoria, which could be attributed to more wild animals on the roads in those regions.
  </p>
  
<div id="map-accidents"></div>
 
<p>To reiterate the map, it is evident that collision with vehicles were consistently the common type of accidents across all months in 2018, with falls from moving vehicle and struck of animals being the minority cause of accidents.
  </p>

 <h2>Is there a correlation between hit & runs and alcohol consumption?</h2>
  
  <p>Alcohol car incidents should be at a zero, let alone alcohol hit & runs. Unfortunately, though, they are more common than they should ever be.
    
    A total of 23 alcohol related and 503 non-alcohol related hit & runs were recorded in 2018.
  </p>

  <h2>Does a higher speed zone lead to greater chance of car accident?</h2>
  
  <p>This visualisation breaks down the three categories of accident severities – fatal accidents, serious injury accidents, and other injury accidents. 
    
    Other injury accidents are the main severity of accidents, as these can arise from minor accidents that aren’t reported in the remaining two categories. It’s a relief to see that fatal accidents only made up a small proportion of Victorian road accidents in 2018, followed by serious injury accidents.
    
    Without doubt, the time of day, light condition, and Victorian region also play a significant role in road accidents. Hence, these can be filtered using the selection menu.
  </p>
  
<div id="bar-severity"></div>
  
  <h2>What type of road accidents resulted in fatality in 2018?</h2>
  
  <p>It is evident that collisions with vehicle are the most common type of road incidents amongst both Metro and Country Victoria. This type of accident is likely to result in serious or other injuries, with rare occurrences of fatality.
    On top of this, the struck of animals on the road in 2018 were not a contributing cause to any fatal accidents.
